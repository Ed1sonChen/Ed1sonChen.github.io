    abstract-less: The integration of diverse sensors in manufacturing processes offers enhanced potential for real-time quality assurance through the collection of complementary data. However, the limited interpretability of current machine learning models often hampers the effective discrimination of each sensor's unique contributions,
    abstract-more: primarily due to the complexity of decoding the interdependencies among various signals. This paper proposes a novel computational framework, Distributed Hyperdimensional Computing (DHDC), which is designed to leverage efficient cognitive operations, such as binding and bundling, for interpretable learning across multi-level sensor data. DHDC operates by encoding and aggregating data systematically across a distributed architecture, thereby enhancing transparency in computational efficiency. Our real-world experimental results on the 5-axis machining for the fabrication of the counterbore hole feature demonstrate that the framework not only effectively characterizes the impact of individual sensors but also achieves a high degree of predictive accuracy, as evidenced by an F1 score of $90.4 \pm 0.013\%$. The proposed framework holds the potential for interpretable and scalable quality control in distributed additive and subtractive manufacturing.

  #   abstract-less: Vision-based object manipulation in assistive mobile cobots essentially relies on classifying the target objects based on their 3D shapes and features, whether they are deformed or not. In this work, we present an auto-generated dataset of deformed objects specific for assistive mobile cobot manipulation using an intuitive Laplacian-based mesh deformation procedure. We 
  #   abstract-more: first determine the graspable region of the robot hand on the given object's mesh. Then, we uniformly sample handle points within the graspable region and perform deformation with multiple handle points based on the robot gripper configuration. In each deformation, we identify the orientation of handle points and prevent self-intersection to guarantee the object's physical meaning when multiple handle points are simultaneously applied to the mesh at different deformation intensities. We also introduce a lightweight neural network for 3D deformable object classification. Finally, we test our generated dataset on the Baxter robot with two 7-DOF arms, an integrated RGB-D camera, and a 3D deformable object classifier. The result shows that the robot is able to classify real-world deformed objects from point clouds captured at multiple views by the RGB-D camera.
